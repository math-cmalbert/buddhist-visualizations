## Adding New Content

2. Copy `templates/principle-template.md` as README.md
3. Add related visualizations in `visualizations/`

### For New Visualizations

2. Link to principle documentation
3. Include both Mermaid source and explanatory text

## Visualization Standards
- Use Mermaid diagrams for consistency
- Include both Tibetan and Sanskrit terms where applicable
- Maintain clear hierarchical structures
- Cross-reference related concepts
